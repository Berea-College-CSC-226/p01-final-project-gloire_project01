## References 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, 
and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have 
helped you, AI tools you've used, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

‚ùóÔ∏è**Title**: `A simple dijital journal.`

‚ùó**Purpose**: `The purpose of this project is to allow users to view, record and manage personal dairy entries.
`

‚ùóÔ∏è**Source Assignment(s)**: ` HW04,HW08, A bugs life and It's in your Genes.`

‚ùóÔ∏è**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
![Don't leave me in your README!](image/crc1.png "Image of CRC card as an example. Upload your CRC card(s) in place of this one. ")

‚ùóÔ∏è**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: muzebag
    Branch 2 name:
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Reflect on what you‚Äôve done so far. How‚Äôs it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    **From what I have done its okay and I am feeling i'm behind. I am worried that I am not sure if I should continue with this or change the project. 
    My feelings toward this project I am little bit anxious but I am feeling good at the same time because i have learn a lot so far and that will help me to finish this project.
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

‚ùóÔ∏è**Completion Percentage**: `80%`

‚ùóÔ∏è**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    I‚Äôm feeling pretty confident about finishing this project. The main functionality is there, but I still need to fix some bugs, 
    clean up the UI. I plan to focus on testing and debugging first to make sure the game works smoothly. After that, I‚Äôll refine the
    UI and add any final touches, like improving the computer‚Äôs moves and maybe adding a replay option. I think with a bit more effort,
    I‚Äôll have it done on time
```

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ‚ùóUser Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 
After hitting the run button in pycharm, a window titled Game of Nim will open. In this game, your goal is to avoid taking 
the last ball. Begin by entering number greater than or equal to 15 in the text box,representing the total number of balls for the game, 
and click Start game. The balls will appear on the canvas, and the game begins. on your turn a popup will ask how many balls you want to 
remove between 1 and 4, enter your choice and then click submit. After your turn the computer will play its turn. The game continues until
there are no balls left, and the player who avoids taking the last ball wins. You can view scores in real time, reset the game using reset
game button, or click instructions to review the rules. 

### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ‚ùóReflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?

I picked this project because I thought it would be fun to create a game that simple but also challenging. The Game of Nim seemed like a good
choice because it involves strategy, and I wanted to learn more about programming games. It helped me learning how to make a graphical
interface with TKinter. Working on this project helped me to do something that i really like and making something that people can enjoy too.

I think my final projrct turned out pretty close to what I had planned. I wanted the game to be easy to use, withclearrule and simple 
gameplay, and I think I accomplished that. The user can take turn, and the computer responds, which works just as i imagined. I wnated to
add extra features but I am happy with how the game turned out.

One of the biggest thing that i learned was how important it is to test your program a lot. I realized separating the logic of the game
from the graphical part would make tasting easier, so I'll keep that in mind for future projects. I also learned more about TKinter and 
how to handle user input. Making sure the program ran smoothly took a lot of trial and error, but it taught me how to stay patient and 
keep trying.

The hardest part was figuring out how to test the game logic without replying on the graphical interface. it was trickly to make sure 
everything worked while alo dealing TKinter. Next time I'd design the dame's logic separetely from the start so it would be easier to test 
and improve. I'd also plan my time better so i could add more features. Overall, this project taught me a lot about progamming and how to
solve problems step by step.
